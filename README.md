# PrivacyEnhAction

PrivacyEnhAction is a web application designed to help users analyse the data collected by smart home devices and fitness trackers in order to identify potential privacy vulnerabilities and inferences that can be drawn from their use. With the growing popularity of these devices, there is an increasing concern about the privacy implications of the data they collect and transmit, and it has become increasingly important to educate users about the data they collect and how they are being shared and used. PrivacyEnhAction aims to address this concern by providing users with a tool that enhances their awareness of the information that is being collected by their devices and the potential inferences that can be drawn from these data. By increasing users' knowledge and understanding of the privacy risks associated with these devices, PrivacyEnhAction can help them make more informed decisions about their use.
